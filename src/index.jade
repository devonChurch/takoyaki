                #My name is Devon Church. I am a developer in New Zealand currently working for Xero.

                I have a passion for the web and the technologies that make it a fast moving, capable and fun platform to build on. In particular, I have worked in various senior development positions for [Fairfax Media](http://www.fairfaxmedia.co.nz/), [stuff.co.nz](http://www.stuff.co.nz/) and [Xero](https://www.xero.com). I have developed executions for many of the country's biggest brands, working under tight deadlines in both individual and collaborative based environments. Below are some of my experimental and production based executions.
