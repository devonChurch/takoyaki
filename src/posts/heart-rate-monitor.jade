        This experiment was another investigation into performant canvas animation. The execution was comprised of various aesthetic elements all hooking into a single requestAnimationFrame call. In that regard I adopted an ES6 class based setup to modularise component in a concise manner.

        Colour transition were achieved using the HSL syntax. This made looping through the hue and controlling the variations of each element was easy using the Luminosity parameter a trivial task.

        I created a mock heart beat in order to get a BPM value registered on screen. The graph animation also hooks into this mock heart beat to get a unique frequency and severity for each “beat”. The easing animation on the beat is generated using a depreciating sine curve function.
