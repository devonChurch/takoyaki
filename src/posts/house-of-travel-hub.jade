        The House of Travel hub was a dedicated section inside stuff.co.nz’s [Travel section](http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel). The page aggregated content from House of Travel and stuff.co.nz’s server into relevant modules throughout the design.

        I created a CMS system for travel Journalists to augment the layout and content of the page at any given time. modules could be reordered or turned on / off, content feeds could be redefined and any static copy of media assets could be directly updated.

        This granular level of control resulted in the hub being updated on a regular basis as there was no need for developer assistance.
