        The Jaguar full page expandable padres was part of a take over campaign on various section on [stuff.co.nz](http://www.stuff.co.nz/). The execution needed to display the same aesthetics and functionality that a premium brand like Jaguar portrayed.

        I relied heavily on complex animations to keep the user engaged throughout the nine screen interactive experience. I liaised closely with agency [Y&R](http://yr.co.nz/) to ensure the finished product was on brand with their nation wide campaign for Jaguar spanning multiple advertising mediums.

        The unit was served through the [Sizmek](http://www.sizmek.com/) platform where I setup a granular analytics systems to report back to Y&R regarding user interaction and customer conversion metrics.
